          All work has been carefully budgeted on the basis of the description
          of the work to be performed in this proposal. Interim changes and / or
          additions to the work are discussed in good time in mutual
          consultation with the client and any additional costs are made
          transparent. Mentioned rates are exclusive of VAT, postage, printing,
          travel and courier costs. Invoicing takes place in several
